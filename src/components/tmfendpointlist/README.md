# TMFEndpointList Component Refactoring

This project provides a comprehensive plan for refactoring the TMFEndpointList component and its associated interfaces. The goal is to improve code maintainability, type safety, and component organization.

## Project Structure

- [**01-current-issues.md**](./01-current-issues.md): Outlines the current issues with the TMFEndpointList component
- [**02-current-interfaces.md**](./02-current-interfaces.md): Documents the current interfaces in the TMFEndpointList component
- [**03-refactoring-plan.md**](./03-refactoring-plan.md): Provides an overview of the refactoring plan with phases
- [**04-implementation-schedule.md**](./04-implementation-schedule.md): Outlines the implementation schedule and prioritization
- [**05-proposed-interfaces.md**](./05-proposed-interfaces.md): Describes the proposed new interface structures
- [**06-component-extraction-guide.md**](./06-component-extraction-guide.md): Provides a guide for component extraction

## Refactoring Objectives

1. **Improve Type Safety**: Create well-defined interfaces with proper type checking
2. **Enhance Code Organization**: Move interfaces to appropriate files and folders
3. **Reduce Component Complexity**: Extract components for better maintainability
4. **Improve State Management**: Implement React Context for shared state
5. **Standardize Data Models**: Create consistent interfaces for data models
6. **Enhance Testability**: Make components more testable with clear responsibilities

## Getting Started

To begin the refactoring process, follow these steps:

1. Review the current issues in [01-current-issues.md](./01-current-issues.md)
2. Understand the current interfaces in [02-current-interfaces.md](./02-current-interfaces.md)
3. Familiarize yourself with the refactoring plan in [03-refactoring-plan.md](./03-refactoring-plan.md)
4. Follow the implementation schedule in [04-implementation-schedule.md](./04-implementation-schedule.md)
5. Use the proposed interfaces in [05-proposed-interfaces.md](./05-proposed-interfaces.md) as a reference
6. Extract components following the guide in [06-component-extraction-guide.md](./06-component-extraction-guide.md)

## Estimated Timeline

The refactoring project is expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks to complete, with the following breakdown:

- **Week 1**: Analysis and setup, consolidate TMFField interface
- **Week 2**: Type refactoring, domain and UI model separation
- **Week 3**: Component extraction and React Context implementation
- **Week 4**: Testing, documentation, and finalization

## Contributing

When contributing to this refactoring project, please ensure that:

1. You follow the type definitions in [05-proposed-interfaces.md](./05-proposed-interfaces.md)
2. You extract components according to the guide in [06-component-extraction-guide.md](./06-component-extraction-guide.md)
3. You write unit tests for new or modified interfaces and components
4. You update documentation as needed
