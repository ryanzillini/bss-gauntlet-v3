# Implementation Schedule and Prioritization

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Analysis and Setup
- **Day 1-2**: Code analysis and detailed planning
- **Day 3-4**: Set up the new type structure
- **Day 5**: Start consolidating TMFField interface

### Week 2: Type Refactoring
- **Day 1-2**: Complete TMFField consolidation
- **Day 3-5**: Implement domain and UI model separation

### Week 3: Component Refactoring
- **Day 1-3**: Extract and refactor components
- **Day 4-5**: Implement React Context and update state management

### Week 4: Testing and Finalization
- **Day 1-3**: Update tests and fix issues
- **Day 4-5**: Document the new structure and finalize the refactoring

## Priority Order for Interface Refactoring

1. **TMFField** - This interface appears in multiple places and is the foundation for other interfaces
2. **MappingResult** - Complex interface with nested structures that needs to be simplified
3. **EditingMapping** - UI state interface that should be separated from domain models
4. **MappingStage** - Used for tracking mapping progress, relatively self-contained
5. **SearchMetadata** - Fairly isolated interface for search functionality
6. **NewEndpoint/AdditionalEndpoint** - Similar interfaces that could be consolidated

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- Changes to TMFField might affect multiple components and services
- Modifying MappingResult could impact API integration and data consistency
- Component extraction might break existing functionality if state management isn't handled correctly

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement changes incrementally with thorough testing at each stage
- Create adapters for backward compatibility during transition
- Use feature flags to enable gradual adoption of new interfaces
- Establish comprehensive test coverage before major refactoring steps
