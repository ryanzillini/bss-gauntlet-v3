# Mapping Workflow

## Process Overview

1. **Documentation Analysis**
   - System ingests API documentation
   - Parses endpoints and specifications
   - Prepares for mapping analysis

2. **Mapping Generation**
   - AI-powered analysis of endpoints
   - Generation of mapping suggestions
   - Confidence score calculation

3. **Review Process**
   - Draft mappings created
   - Human review of suggestions
   - Approval or rejection workflow

4. **Implementation**
   - Storage of approved mappings
   - Version control of mappings
   - Implementation tracking

## Mapping States

- **Draft**: Initial AI-generated mapping
- **Approved**: Validated and ready for use
- **Rejected**: Declined mapping suggestions

## Confidence Scoring

Mappings include confidence scores based on:
- Parameter matching
- Response structure similarity
- Semantic relevance
- Historical mapping patterns
