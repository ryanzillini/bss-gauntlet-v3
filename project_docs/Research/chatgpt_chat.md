To build an AI agent that can crawl through a complex list of APIs, find the right endpoint, and make a call to it, follow these steps:

1. Define the Scope and Input Format
Identify the APIs you need to interact with.
Understand the documentation format (Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman collections, raw documentation).
Determine the types of queries the AI will process.
2. Data Collection and Parsing
If APIs have structured documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), parse JSON/YAML definitions.
If documentation is unstructured, use NLP techniques to extract relevant endpoints.
Store API metadata (URL, parameters, authentication methods).
3. Search and Selection Logic
Use a search algorithm (e.g., fuzzy matching, vector search) to find the best API endpoint for a given query.
Implement similarity scoring using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-ada-002 or Sentence-BERT).
Rank endpoints based on relevance.
4. API Request Construction
Retrieve the necessary parameters (query, path, headers, authentication).
Automatically generate request payloads.
Validate required vs. optional fields.
5. Execution and Error Handling
Make the API request using requests (Python) or axios (JavaScript).
Implement retry logic, rate-limiting, and exponential backoff.
Handle authentication (API keys, OAuth, JWT, etc.).
Parse the response and return meaningful output.
6. AI Enhancement (Optional)
Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT) to understand API documentation and suggest improvements.
Use an agent-based approach (LangChain, AutoGPT) to explore and test APIs dynamically.
7. Deployment and Testing
Deploy as a microservice or integrate into a chatbot.
Use logging and monitoring for API performance.
Write test cases for different scenarios.

somethign klike this
ChatGPT said:
Yes! This is an example of a GraphQL API documentation for the Totogi Charging as a Service API. It includes available queries, types, and endpoints.

For your AI agent, the process would be:

Parse API Documentation: Extract endpoints, queries, mutations, and required parameters.
Identify the Right Query/Mutation: Use NLP to match user intent with available queries.
Construct GraphQL Queries Dynamically: Generate requests in GraphQL format.
Authenticate and Execute Requests: Handle API keys or authentication tokens.
Process and Return Responses: Format and present API responses in a meaningful way.
Would you like a Python script to interact with this API dynamically?







You said:
Yes that would be great

Here's a Python script that interacts with the Totogi Charging as a Service API dynamically. This script:

Parses the GraphQL API documentation.
Finds the right endpoint.
Constructs and sends a GraphQL query.
Handles authentication and errors.
You'll need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with a valid key.

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

# Totogi GraphQL API Endpoint (Choose based on region)
API_URL = "https://gql.produsheast1.api.totogi.com/graphql"  # US Tenants
# API_URL = "https://gql.prodapsoutheast1.api.totogi.com/graphql"  # Singapore Tenants

# Replace with your API key or authentication token
HEADERS = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Example GraphQL Query for getAccount
def get_account(account_id: str):
    query = """
    query getAccount($id: String!) {
        getAccount(id: $id) {
            id
            name
            balance
        }
    }
    """
    variables = {"id": account_id}

    response = requests.post(API_URL, json={"query": query, "variables": variables}, headers=HEADERS)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": f"Request failed with status {response.status_code}", "details": response.text}

# Example Usage
account_id = "12345"
result = get_account(account_id)
print(result)
Features of this Script:
‚úî Uses GraphQL Queries
‚úî Sends requests dynamically based on input
‚úî Handles authentication
‚úî Parses and returns JSON responses

So i have a React front end for this project. 

The user would log in, paste the link to the API documentation, supply their API key, and then ask the interface to get them some data.

Id actaully prefer to run this in typescript because of that, can you give me a typescript function to accomplish the same thing
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Here's a TypeScript function that performs the same GraphQL query in your React frontend.

Steps this function follows:
‚úÖ Accepts an API URL, API key, and GraphQL query with variables.
‚úÖ Sends a request using fetch().
‚úÖ Handles authentication and errors.

typescript
Copy
Edit
export async function fetchGraphQLData(
  apiUrl: string,
  apiKey: string,
  query: string,
  variables: Record<string, any>
): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`GraphQL request failed with status ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching GraphQL data:", error);
    return { error: error.message };
  }
}
Example Usage in React Component
typescript
Copy
Edit
const apiUrl = "https://gql.produsheast1.api.totogi.com/graphql";  // Replace with user input
const apiKey = "USER_SUPPLIED_API_KEY";  // From user input
const query = `
  query getAccount($id: String!) {
    getAccount(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      balance
    }
  }
`;
const variables = { id: "12345" };

fetchGraphQLData(apiUrl, apiKey, query, variables)
  .then(data => console.log("API Response:", data))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
Next Steps
Integrate this into a React UI form where users can paste the API URL and key.
Allow users to dynamically enter queries.
Display results in a table or JSON viewer.

right but i need some way for my natural langauge request to be processed by my ssystem to find the rigth endpoints to create teh full request
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
To process natural language requests and map them to the correct API endpoints, follow this approach:

1. Extract API Structure from Documentation
If the API documentation is in OpenAPI/Swagger format, parse it directly.
If it's in raw text, use NLP techniques (e.g., embeddings, regex) to extract endpoints, queries, and parameters.
2. Convert Natural Language to API Query
Use LLMs (like GPT or OpenAI‚Äôs API) to interpret user intent.
Map intent to API endpoints using semantic search (e.g., vector embeddings via OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002).
Identify required parameters dynamically.
3. Construct the GraphQL Query
Based on the matched endpoint, generate the correct GraphQL query or REST request.
Fill in necessary parameters.
Implementation Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract API Endpoints and Queries
Use OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-ada-002 to store API query descriptions in a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Right Query with NLP
When a user asks for data in natural language, compare their request against stored embeddings to find the closest API query.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate API Call Automatically
Once the system selects the correct API query, format it into a valid GraphQL/REST request with necessary parameters.

Would You Like a Code Example?
I can provide a TypeScript function using OpenAI embeddings + a search algorithm to map user requests to API queries. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! üöÄ







You said:
is there another technique that doesnt require processing and moving it up to RAG, like couldnt i just give the agent the documentation url and it could search it on its own
ChatGPT said:
Memory updated
Yes! Instead of using RAG, you can have the agent directly fetch and parse the API documentation from the provided URL. Here's how:

1. Fetch the API Documentation
If the documentation is structured (Swagger/OpenAPI), fetch the JSON/YAML file.
If it‚Äôs a web page, scrape the content using cheerio (for HTML parsing) in Node.js.
2. Extract Endpoints and Queries
If OpenAPI, extract available endpoints, methods, and parameters.
If GraphQL, extract queries, mutations, and types.
3. Search for the Right Endpoint
Use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuse.js) to compare user input with extracted API descriptions.
Rank the most relevant API operations.
4. Construct the API Request
Once the best-matching endpoint is found, generate a valid request.
Fill in required parameters dynamically.
Would You Like a TypeScript Implementation?
I can provide a function that: ‚úÖ Fetches the API documentation from a URL.
‚úÖ Extracts API endpoints and queries.
‚úÖ Searches for the best match based on user input.
‚úÖ Constructs and executes the API request.

Let me know how you'd like to structure this! üöÄ







You said:
yes a type script implemnetnation that completes those 4 items would be perfect
ChatGPT said:
I'll provide a TypeScript implementation that:
‚úÖ Fetches API documentation from a URL
‚úÖ Extracts API endpoints and queries
‚úÖ Searches for the best match based on user input
‚úÖ Constructs and executes the API request

This solution assumes that the API documentation is in Swagger/OpenAPI JSON format. If the documentation is a raw HTML page, we can modify this to use cheerio for parsing.

üîπ TypeScript Implementation
This script:

Fetches and parses OpenAPI documentation.
Finds the most relevant endpoint using fuzzy search (fuse.js).
Constructs and executes the request dynamically.
typescript
Copy
Edit
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import Fuse from "fuse.js";

interface OpenAPI {
  paths: {
    [key: string]: {
      [method: string]: {
        summary?: string;
        description?: string;
        parameters?: any[];
      };
    };
  };
}

interface MatchResult {
  path: string;
  method: string;
  endpointDetails: any;
}

async function fetchAPIDocumentation(docUrl: string): Promise<OpenAPI | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(docUrl);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Failed to fetch API documentation`);
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching API documentation:", error);
    return null;
  }
}

function findBestMatch(userQuery: string, apiDocs: OpenAPI): MatchResult | null {
  const endpointList: { path: string; method: string; description: string }[] = [];

  for (const [path, methods] of Object.entries(apiDocs.paths)) {
    for (const [method, details] of Object.entries(methods)) {
      endpointList.push({ path, method, description: details.summary || details.description || "" });
    }
  }

  const fuse = new Fuse(endpointList, { keys: ["description"], threshold: 0.3 });
  const bestMatch = fuse.search(userQuery)[0];

  return bestMatch ? { path: bestMatch.item.path, method: bestMatch.item.method, endpointDetails: bestMatch.item } : null;
}

async function executeAPIRequest(apiUrl: string, apiKey: string, match: MatchResult, userParams: any) {
  const fullUrl = `${apiUrl}${match.path}`;
  const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json", Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` };

  const response = await fetch(fullUrl, {
    method: match.method.toUpperCase(),
    headers,
    body: match.method !== "get" ? JSON.stringify(userParams) : undefined,
  });

  return await response.json();
}

async function processUserRequest(apiDocUrl: string, apiUrl: string, apiKey: string, userQuery: string, userParams: any) {
  const apiDocs = await fetchAPIDocumentation(apiDocUrl);
  if (!apiDocs) return "Failed to retrieve API documentation.";

  const bestMatch = findBestMatch(userQuery, apiDocs);
  if (!bestMatch) return "No matching API endpoint found.";

  return await executeAPIRequest(apiUrl, apiKey, bestMatch, userParams);
}

// Example Usage
const apiDocUrl = "https://example.com/openapi.json"; // Replace with actual URL
const apiUrl = "https://api.example.com"; // Replace with actual base API URL
const apiKey = "USER_SUPPLIED_API_KEY"; // User-provided API Key
const userQuery = "Get account details"; // Natural language request
const userParams = { id: "12345" }; // Parameters for the request

processUserRequest(apiDocUrl, apiUrl, apiKey, userQuery, userParams)
  .then(response => console.log("API Response:", response))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
üîπ How It Works
Fetch API Documentation
Downloads OpenAPI JSON from the given URL.
Extract Endpoints & Use Fuzzy Search (fuse.js)
Searches for the best API match using the user‚Äôs natural language request.
Generate the API Call Dynamically
Constructs a request with parameters.
Execute API Request & Return Response
Calls the endpoint and returns data.
üîπ Next Steps
Integrate this into your React frontend to accept user input dynamically.
If API documentation is an HTML page instead of JSON, use cheerio to extract content.
Add support for GraphQL APIs (query/mutation extraction).

what is TM Forum
ChatGPT said:
TM Forum is a global industry association for telecommunications and digital service providers. It provides frameworks, standards, and best practices to help telecom companies improve operations, drive innovation, and adopt new technologies.

Key Aspects of TM Forum:
Open Digital Architecture (ODA):
A standardized framework for building and integrating telecom IT systems.
Open APIs:
A set of REST-based APIs designed to enable interoperability between telecom systems and third-party services.
Business Process Framework (eTOM):
A standard model for telecom business processes, covering everything from customer management to network operations.
Information Framework (SID):
A standardized data model to unify information management across telecom systems.
AI and Automation Standards:
Guidelines for implementing AI and automation in telecom networks.
Why It Matters?
TM Forum helps telecom companies reduce costs, accelerate digital transformation, and improve interoperability by providing standardized APIs and frameworks.

Would you like to integrate TM Forum Open APIs into your AI-driven API agent? üöÄ







You said:
is it a business?  or it just sets the standards....what if a telecom company isnt using the TM Forum standard for say customer data
ChatGPT said:
TM Forum is not a business in the traditional sense; it's a non-profit industry association that sets standards, best practices, and frameworks for telecom and digital service providers.

TM Forum‚Äôs Role:
It does not operate telecom services but helps telecom companies standardize their IT systems.
Provides frameworks (e.g., Open APIs, eTOM, SID) to ensure seamless integration and interoperability.
Collaborates with major telecom operators, vendors, and technology providers worldwide.
What If a Telecom Company Doesn‚Äôt Use TM Forum Standards?
If a telecom company doesn‚Äôt use TM Forum standards for customer data (or other areas), then:
‚úÖ Their systems may be proprietary and customized, making integrations more complex.
‚úÖ Third-party vendors or partners may need custom APIs instead of using TM Forum's Open APIs.
‚úÖ They might struggle with interoperability when working with global vendors who follow TM Forum standards.

Does It Matter?
If your AI agent needs to integrate with multiple telecoms, following TM Forum standards would make it easier to handle different providers.
However, if a telecom provider has custom APIs, your system must dynamically process their documentation (which aligns with your AI-driven API approach).
Would you like to explore how to handle both TM Forum-compliant and non-compliant APIs in your system? üöÄ

how can we incporapate MCP into this workflow
ChatGPT said:
Incorporating TM Forum‚Äôs MCP (Managed Component Providers) into Your Workflow
Managed Component Providers (MCP) is part of TM Forum‚Äôs Open Digital Architecture (ODA), where telecom software components are provided as modular, standardized building blocks.

Since your AI agent needs to crawl API documentation, find the right endpoint, and make API calls dynamically, MCP can streamline this process if you're working with telecom companies that follow TM Forum standards.

üîπ How MCP Fits into Your AI Agent Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Discover APIs from MCP Components

MCP components expose standardized TM Forum Open APIs.
Your system can fetch and index available APIs dynamically.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Map Natural Language Queries to MCP APIs

Instead of manually parsing APIs, you can pre-load TM Forum Open APIs from MCP providers.
Your AI agent can then match user queries to predefined MCP API functions (e.g., Customer Management, Billing, Product Catalog).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate and Execute API Calls

Once the AI agent identifies the correct MCP API, it constructs the request dynamically.
Uses TM Forum‚Äôs standardized data models (SID) to structure data correctly.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Handle Non-TM Forum APIs Seamlessly

If a telecom company doesn‚Äôt follow MCP/TM Forum, your AI agent can fall back to its existing method (crawling API docs dynamically).
üîπ Example Workflow with MCP
Without MCP (Generic API Crawling)
Fetch OpenAPI docs from custom telecom APIs.
Parse endpoints, map user request using fuzzy matching.
Construct and execute API requests.
With MCP Integration
‚úÖ Use pre-registered Open APIs from MCP providers instead of parsing docs manually.
‚úÖ Directly map natural language queries to standard TM Forum APIs (faster and more reliable).
‚úÖ No need for complex NLP-based endpoint discovery since TM Forum APIs are already structured.
