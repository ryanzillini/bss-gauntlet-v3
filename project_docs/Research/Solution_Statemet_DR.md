The AI-first telco won't wait 5 years for Amdocs

True story: there’s a telco trying to move off Amdocs and onto another large BSS provider. Want to guess the timeline? FIVE YEARS. Half of that time will be spent on data migration—and the new vendor isn’t optimistic the transition will even work.

In the age of AI, if this swap-off project is successful, how much do you think the BSS landscape will have changed by 2030? And if you could shorten the implementation timeline, even by HALF, how much would that be worth to the telco? Certainly more than just the millions of dollars saved in implementation fees. It’s huge.

This is exactly why the telco industry needs to change. While legacy vendors keep promising TM Forum Open API support ‘soon,’ Totogi just made their promises irrelevant—because we can extend these APIs to any BSS system without touching a single line of source code.

All because of generative AI.
Let that sink in for a moment. For a typical Tier-1 operator, this means slashing integration costs by 60% and cutting implementation time from years to months. No more waiting for vendors to get around to implementing standards that should have been there years ago. No more million-dollar integration projects that somehow always run over budget. No more being held hostage to vendors’ timelines and profit margins.

You know the problem this solves all too well: telcos are burning 80% of their IT budgets on integration and customization, leaving a mere 20% for actual innovation. Look at any major operator—they’re drowning in a sea of incompatible systems. Take Vodafone: 180 BSS/OSS applications in each of its 24 markets. That’s 4,000+ applications that need to work together seamlessly. And every time vendors update their system? The integration headaches start all over again.

What if you could implement a standard TM Forum inventory API across your entire stack next quarter, not years from now? Want to add a new customer-management API? It becomes only days of work, not months and months of complex integration projects. Who doesn’t want that?

How we made the impossible possible
Previous attempts to solve this relied on building ever-more-complex middleware layers, which just created another integration problem to solve. So Totogi took a completely different approach. Instead of adding more layers, we created BSS Magic—powered by something we call the “telco ontology.” Think of it as a universal translator that actually understands telecom. Not just at a surface level, but deep in its DNA. When we connect it to any system—and we mean any system, not just Totogi’s—it automatically maps everything to a common data model.

Your billing system calls it a “subscriber?” Your CRM calls it a “customer?” Your charging system calls it an “account?” BSS Magic doesn’t care. It knows they’re all talking about the same thing. It’s like having a brilliant systems architect who speaks every vendor’s language fluently, working at AI speed.

Here’s how it works for you
Let’s talk about what this means for you and your IT team. Let’s say you want to implement TM Forum’s Product Inventory Management API (TMF637) across your systems. Traditionally, this would mean:

Waiting for each vendor to support the API (spoiler: they’re “working on it”)
Paying for expensive customization when they finally do
Dealing with subtle differences in how each vendor interpreted the standard
Integration testing. Endless integration testing.
With BSS Magic? You connect your systems once. Our ontology already understands what product inventory means across different vendors—whether they call it a “product catalog,” “service inventory,” or “offering database.” The AI then generates the code needed to expose a standards-compliant TMF637 API for each system automatically.

The result? You get a perfect implementation of TMF637 across your entire stack. No vendor dependencies. No integration nightmares. No waiting.

BSS Magic isn’t just translating APIs; it’s giving you a powerful AI interface to work with them. Want to query your inventory across systems? Just ask in plain English. Want to create a new product offering? The AI understands your intent and handles all the complex orchestration behind the scenes.

But don’t take my word for it. We’re already using this in the real world with real telcos.

Real results in days, not weeks
Last month, we had a perfect comparison case: two NewNet system upgrades of similar size and complexity, separated by just months, but worlds apart in approach. Project 1 (2024) took six weeks using traditional methods to migrate the data. Project 2 (2025) took just four days with BSS Magic. Our next target? Four hours.

But speed is just the beginning. A North American Tier 1 telco wanted to switch billing systems for a small services offering. It wanted to move from a $280k/year system to a $70k/year system. With BSS Magic, we mapped the data in mere minutes and migrated the integrations with generated AI code. The whole project took less than two weeks, all because of the ontological mapping and data layer.

And here’s where it gets even better: BSS Magic isn’t just about faster integration—it’s about giving you an entirely new way to work with your systems. Think of it as your telco systems architect on steroids. Need to check if a customer is eligible for an upgrade across all your systems? Instead of writing complex queries for each database, just ask: “Show me all gold-tier subscribers who’ve been with us for 3+ years and haven’t upgraded their device in the last 18 months.”

The AI understands what you need, knows where to find the data (even if it’s scattered across your CRM, billing, and inventory systems), and returns exactly what you asked for. No SQL queries. No API integration. No data mapping headaches. No coding by your IT team.

Want to create a new promotional bundle? Instead of orchestrating changes across multiple systems, just describe what you want: “Create a holiday bundle that includes our premium 5G plan, Disney+ subscription, and a device upgrade option.” BSS Magic’s AI handles all the heavy lifting—updating product catalogs, configuring charging rules, and setting up the eligibility criteria across your stack.

This isn’t sci-fi; it’s what our customers are doing today. While legacy vendors are still planning five-year migrations, we’re already delivering the future of BSS.

The future is yours to shape
Think about what this really means for your business. With BSS Magic’s AI-powered integration, you can finally break free from rigid systems and expensive consultants. You can innovate at the speed of your imagination, not your vendor’s timeline. And you can do it now, not in some distant future state.

Ready to see this transformation yourself? Join me at MWC25’s GenAI Summit in Hall 6 on Monday, March 3, where I’ll lay out the roadmap to create the AI-first Telco. Can’t make it to the summit? Stop by the Totogi booth for a live demo of BSS Magic transforming weeks of work into minutes.

Aren’t you tired of paying ransom to legacy vendors? It’s time to set your telco free!
