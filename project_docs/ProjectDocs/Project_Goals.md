Project Goals:
Build an enterprise grade V1 of BSS Magic, starting at the data layer using Howard’s product specification. This is a platform that can connect to any other vendor’s BSS product and understand its data structure.

Build an MCP server for the telco data model using MCP-Hive. You will get most of the(AI)PI functionality out of the box and can then accomplish more in the 100 hours. MCP-Hive is ephor-bus enabled. 

To start, ingest Totogi, CloudSense, and STL to test that it works. These 3 were selected because we own the products and the source code, so we can easily see if your adapter works.

Bonus:
Map the connected system to TM Forum APIs and produce working code to read and write to the system with the TM Forum APIs, converting back and forth to the source’s API set if necessary.

Bonus Bonus:
Automated the certification of CloudSense with the TM Forum APIs and move onto on this leaderboard:

Bonus Bonus Bonus:
Use the automation to certify Totogi with the TM Forum APIs and move up on the leaderboard (currently at 44, could we do more?)
