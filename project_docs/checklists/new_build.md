Yes, your goal makes sense. Essentially, you're building a tool that acts as a bridge between non-standardized telecom APIs and TM Forum-compliant APIs. The tool will allow IT specialists to input their API documentation URLs, and the platform will transform these into standardized TM Forum API endpoints that can be called by users adhering to TM Forum standards.
Here’s a checklist to help you start from scratch:

Project Checklist: API Transformer for TM Forum Compliance
1. Define Scope & Requirements
[ ] User Persona: Identify the primary users (e.g., IT specialists, telecom developers).
[ ] Input: Define the format of API documentation URLs (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman collections, raw docs).
[ ] Output: Define the expected output format (TM Forum-compliant API endpoints).
[ ] Use Cases: List common use cases (e.g., transforming customer management APIs, billing APIs, etc.).
[ ] Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, scalability, security, and error handling.
2. Data Collection & Parsing
[ ] API Documentation Crawler: Build a crawler to fetch API documentation from provided URLs.
[ ] Parsing Logic: Implement parsers for different documentation formats (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, raw HTML/PDF).
[ ] Metadata Extraction: Extract key metadata (e.g., endpoints, parameters, authentication methods).
3. Mapping & Transformation
[ ] TM Forum API Standards: Load TM Forum Open API specifications (e.g., TMF620 for Product Catalog, TMF622 for Customer Management).
[ ] Mapping Logic: Develop algorithms to map non-standard API endpoints to TM Forum-compliant ones.
[ ] Fuzzy Matching: Use fuzzy matching to identify similar endpoints.
[ ] AI Suggestions: Use AI (e.g., GPT) to suggest mappings based on semantic similarity.
[ ] Data Model Translation: Translate non-standard data models (e.g., "customer" vs. "subscriber") to TM Forum’s SID (Shared Information/Data) model.
4. API Request Construction
[ ] Parameter Mapping: Map parameters from non-standard APIs to TM Forum-compliant ones.
[ ] Request Generation: Automatically generate TM Forum-compliant API requests.
[ ] Authentication Handling: Support various authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth, JWT).
5. Execution & Error Handling
[ ] API Call Execution: Implement logic to execute TM Forum-compliant API calls.
[ ] Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully (e.g., retries, rate-limiting, exponential backoff).
[ ] Response Parsing: Parse responses and return them in a standardized format.
6. AI Enhancement (Optional)
[ ] LLM Integration: Fine-tune a language model (e.g., GPT) to understand API documentation and suggest improvements.
[ ] Agent-Based Approach: Use frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPT to dynamically explore and test APIs.
[ ] Feedback Loop: Allow users to provide feedback on mappings to improve AI accuracy.
7. User Interface
[ ] Input Form: Create a simple UI for users to input API documentation URLs.
[ ] Mapping Visualization: Show a visual representation of the mapping between non-standard and TM Forum-compliant APIs.
[ ] Testing Interface: Allow users to test the transformed API endpoints directly from the platform.
8. Deployment & Testing
[ ] Microservice Architecture: Deploy the tool as a microservice for scalability.
[ ] Logging & Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring for API performance and errors.
[ ] Test Cases: Write test cases for different scenarios (e.g., valid/invalid URLs, different documentation formats).
9. Integration with TM Forum MCP (Optional)
[ ] MCP Integration: Fetch TM Forum Open APIs from MCP providers for faster and more reliable mapping.
[ ] Context Switching: Implement logic to switch between TM Forum-compliant and non-compliant APIs seamlessly.
10. Documentation & Support
[ ] User Guide: Create a user guide for IT specialists on how to use the tool.
[ ] API Documentation: Document the transformed TM Forum-compliant APIs.
[ ] Support System: Set up a support system for users to report issues or request features.

Next Steps
1. Prototype: Start with a basic prototype that can parse Swagger/OpenAPI docs and map them to TM Forum APIs.
Iterate: Test the prototype with real-world API documentation and gather user feedback.
3. Scale: Gradually add support for more documentation formats and enhance the AI capabilities.
This checklist should help you systematically build the tool while ensuring it meets the needs of IT specialists in the telecom industry. Let me know if you need further assistance!
