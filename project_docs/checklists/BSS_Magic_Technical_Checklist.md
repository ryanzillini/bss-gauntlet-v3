# BSS Magic Technical Implementation Checklist

Solution Summary
In a nutshell, how are we solving the problem?
Separate runtime and design-time into distinct components with potentially different architectures
Use a declarative approach to define the ontology mapping between TMF APIs and customer data sources
Implement AI using Amazon Bedrock high-level primitives
Secure APIs using Amazon Cognito

AI is used to make the ontology mapping process 100x faster than manual work:
Automated Mappings – AI analyzes the customer's data sources and maps to TM Forum based on the TM Forum Business Process Framework, schema, semantics, and best practices
Guided Refinement – AI helps users review, validate, and modify mappings through an intuitive UI
Querying Data – AI can interrogate APIs, inspect sample payloads, and generate test queries to validate mappings
Ensuring Consistency – AI identifies inconsistencies and flags potential data mismatches before they impact runtime behavior
