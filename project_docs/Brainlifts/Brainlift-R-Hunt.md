BSS Magic Gauntlet Project

- Purpose
  - BSS Magic doesn't require replacing existing systems or creating more point-to-point integrations. Instead, it brings legacy systems to life by abstracting business logic to an AI layer that can work across any system through the ontological mapping layer. This approach reduces integration time from months to days and allows telcos to innovate without being held back by their legacy infrastructure.
