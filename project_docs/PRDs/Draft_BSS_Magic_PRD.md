# BSS Magic Product Requirements Document (Complete)

## Executive Summary
BSS Magic is an innovative platform designed to modernize telecom Business Support Systems (BSS) by leveraging AI-driven automation and a unified ontological layer. This document outlines the infrastructure, tech stack, user stories, development timeline, and risk management strategies to deliver an enterprise-grade version of BSS Magic.

## Infrastructure
1. **Cloud Platform**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
   - **Rationale**: Provides scalable, reliable, and secure cloud services.
2. **Compute**: EC2 instances for runtime, Lambda for serverless functions
   - **Rationale**: EC2 for persistent workloads, Lambda for event-driven tasks.
3. **Database**: DynamoDB for metadata storage, RDS for relational data
   - **Rationale**: DynamoDB for high availability and scalability, RDS for complex queries.
4. **AI Services**: Amazon Bedrock for AI capabilities
   - **Rationale**: Offers pre-trained models and high-level AI primitives.
5. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway for TM Forum API exposure
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies API management and security.
6. **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito for API security
   - **Rationale**: Provides secure user authentication and authorization.
7. **Message Bus**: Ephor-bus enabled MCP-Hive for event-driven architecture
   - **Rationale**: Supports asynchronous communication and scalability.

## Tech Stack
1. **Core Language**: Java (strongly typed, rich ecosystem)
   - **Rationale**: Ensures robustness and access to a wide range of libraries.
2. **Integration Framework**: Apache Camel or Trino
   - **Rationale**: Facilitates seamless data integration and transformation.
3. **AI Framework**: Amazon Bedrock Agents
   - **Rationale**: Leverages AI for intelligent data mapping and automation.
4. **API Standards**: TM Forum Open APIs
   - **Rationale**: Ensures industry-standard interoperability.
5. **Data Mapping**: Declarative configuration (JSON/YAML)
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies configuration and enhances maintainability.
6. **Testing Framework**: JUnit for unit tests, Postman for API tests
   - **Rationale**: Ensures code quality and API reliability.
7. **CI/CD**: Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline
   - **Rationale**: Automates build, test, and deployment processes.

## User Stories
### Core Functionality
1. As a Telecom Developer, I want to connect legacy BSS systems to BSS Magic so that I can modernize without replacing existing infrastructure.
2. As a System Administrator, I want to map legacy data models to TM Forum standards so that I can ensure interoperability.
3. As a Product Manager, I want to use AI-generated mappings so that I can reduce integration time from months to days.

### Bonus Features
4. As a Developer, I want to automatically generate TM Forum API code so that I can quickly implement new integrations.
5. As a QA Engineer, I want to automate TM Forum API certification so that I can ensure compliance with industry standards.
6. As a CTO, I want to see our systems move up the TM Forum leaderboard so that I can demonstrate our commitment to industry standards.
