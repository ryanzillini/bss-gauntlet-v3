# BSS Magic Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
BSS Magic is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to modernize telecom Business Support Systems (BSS) without the need for complete replacement. By leveraging a unified ontological layer and advanced AI automation, BSS Magic enables seamless integration of legacy systems with modern TM Forum APIs, drastically reducing integration timelines while ensuring industry compliance.

## Infrastructure
1. **Cloud Platform:** AWS  
   - EC2 instances for persistent workloads and Lambda for event-driven functions  
   - DynamoDB for metadata storage and RDS for relational data processing  
2. **AI Services:** Amazon Bedrock provides pre-trained models to drive intelligent mapping and automation.  
3. **API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway secures and simplifies TM Forum API exposure.  
4. **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito ensures secure user authentication and authorization.  
5. **Message Bus:** Ephor-bus enabled MCP-Hive supports our event-driven architecture and asynchronous processing.  
6. **AI Agent Infrastructure:** Deployed via ECS/EKS with an Agent Orchestration Layer to coordinate distributed AI agents for mapping and runtime tasks.

## Tech Stack
1. **Core Language:** Java – chosen for robustness and a rich ecosystem of libraries.  
2. **Integration Frameworks:** Apache Camel or Trino for seamless data and API integration.  
3. **AI Framework:** Amazon Bedrock Agents drive automated mapping and validation.  
4. **API Standards:** TM Forum Open APIs ensure industry-standard interoperability across telecom systems.  
5. **Data Mapping:** Declarative configuration using JSON/YAML simplifies legacy-to-modern data integration.  
6. **Testing:** JUnit (unit tests) and Postman (API tests) alongside AI-assisted validation routines.  
7. **CI/CD:** Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline to automate build, test, and deployment processes.  
8. **Ontological Framework:** OWL for semantic modeling with GraphDB for storage of ontological mappings.
